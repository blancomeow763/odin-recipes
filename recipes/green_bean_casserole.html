    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Green Beans (2 14.5 ounce cans)</strong>: This easy green bean casserole starts with two drained cans of green beans.</li>
        <li><strong>Canned Soup (1 10.5 ounce can)</strong>: A can of condensed cream of mushroom soup creates a creamy texture and adds savory flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese (1 cup, divided)</strong>: This recipe calls for shredded Cheddar cheese. Use sharp, mild, or a blend of both.</li>
        <li><strong>French-Fried Onions (1 6 ounce can)</strong>: The green bean casserole gets its crunch from a French-fried onion topping.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional ingredients</strong>: Crumbled bacon, sauteed mushrooms or onions, garlic, Parmesian cheese, black pepper.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
        <li>Mix green beans and condensed soup together in a large microwave-safe bowl until well combined. Microwave on high until warm, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese into the green bean mixture. Microwave on high for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer mixture to a casserole dish and spread evenly over the bottom. Sprinkle French-fried onions over top, then sprinkle with remaining Cheddar.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and onions are just turning brown, about 10 minutes.</li>
